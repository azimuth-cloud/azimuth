Deployment of EOS-Portal.  How do we make it both simple and secure?

We want a master directory under a dedicated account:

/home/cloudhands-eos/

Under this, owned by cloudhands-eos:

eos-db/
eos-agents/
eos-portal/
py3venv/
run/

And under run/

eos-db/ owned by eos-db
  Contains database password (if we had one).  Symlink eos-db/eos_db/config.py to here.
  Contains agent_secret and token_secret
  Has logs for the DB
eos-agents/ owned by eos-agents
  Contains the VCloud username/password.  Likewise, config.py is symlinked into eos-agents.
  Contains agent_secret
  Has logs for the agents
  Has database of warnings sent from the , if I ever make one
eos-portal/ owned by www-data
  Contains the token secret, if I need one?
  Has logs for the web portal server

Deployment script.  I could put this under eos-portal but instruct people to download it and run it.

1) Check for git and python requisites and www-data/nobody user.
1a) umask 022
2) Create user 'cloudhands-eos', with empty HOME /home/cloudhands-eos
   useradd -MU cloudhands-eos
   install -d "`getent passwd cloudhands-eos | cut -d: -f6`" -o cloudhands-eos -m755
3) Make $HOME/var
   cd "`getent passwd cloudhands-eos | cut -d: -f6`"
   install -d var -o cloudhands-eos -m755
4) Create eos-db and eos-agents users with HOME's under ./var/
   useradd -MN -b "`pwd`"/var -g cloudhands-eos eos-db
   useradd -MN -b "`pwd`"/var -g cloudhands-eos eos-agents
   install -d var/eos-db -o eos-db -m755
   install -d var/eos-db -o eos-agents -m755
5) Create eos-portal directory owned by www-data/nobody
   install -d var/eos-portal -o www-data -m755
6) As cloudhands-eos user, git clone all 3 repos
   sudo -Hu cloudhands-eos ...
7) Build initial py3venv
   ...
8) 'setup.py develop' on all three modules
   ...

Now, it might seem much more reasonable to bundle a pre-made py3venv and use this in place of 6-8.
This would also work, but I'd need to see what happens with the password config.  In any case,
running the code will be the same.

9) Prompt the user to configure any passwords and then to run 'sudo controller.sh'.  Each service will
   be run as the owner of the relevant var/ directory, so on the test machine I can use one owner
   for all three services.
