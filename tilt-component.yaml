#####
# NOTE
#
#Â The build/push/deploy cycle doesn't really work for UI development as the
# feedback cycle is too slow - this is because even a change to a single file
# triggers a whole production rebuild including obfuscation, tree-shaking etc.
#
# Instead of changing the container build, which is what we want for prod, we
# instead set up a port forward for the Azimuth API and run the UI locally using
# a local_resource
