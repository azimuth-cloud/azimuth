The `jasmin-cloud` project is a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
application that provides an HTTP API for administration of tenancies in the
JASMIN Cloud.

The API is intended to be a simplification of the underlying cloud platform,
where the available actions are restricted to those explicitly
[supported by the JASMIN team](https://accounts.jasmin.ac.uk/account/support/).

It is used by the [JASMIN Cloud Portal](https://github.com/cedadev/jasmin-cloud-ui),
which provides a Javascript-based web user interface for the JASMIN Cloud.
