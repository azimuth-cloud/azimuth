Introduction
============

The ``jasmin-cloud`` project is a `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_
application that provides an HTTP API for administration of tenancies in the
JASMIN Cloud.

The API is intended to be a simplification of the underlying cloud platform,
where the available actions are restricted to those explicitly
`supported by the JASMIN team <https://accounts.jasmin.ac.uk/account/support/>`_.

It is used by the `JASMIN Cloud Portal <https://github.com/cedadev/jasmin-cloud-ui>`_,
which provides a Javascript-based web user interface for the JASMIN Cloud.
