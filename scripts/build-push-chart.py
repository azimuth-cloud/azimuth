"""
This script sets the "version" and "appVersion" of a chart before packaging it and
pushing it to an OCI repository.

The version is derived from a combination of the latest Git tag and the current SHA.
It assumes that the tags are SemVer compliant, i.e. are of the form
`<major>.<minor>.<patch>-<prerelease>`.

The appVersion is derived from the current SHA, as produced when using
`tags: type=sha,prefix=` with `docker/metadata-action`.

This means that referencing the chart at a particular SHA automatically picks up
the correct images for that version.
